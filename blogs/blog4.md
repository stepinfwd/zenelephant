# **BTS: Behind-the-Scenes: Shooting the Grid-Tsugi’s  Trailer**

# **Introduction: idea**

> "Creating a game trailer is not just about showcasing stunning gameplay—it’s about crafting an experience that immerses the viewer. For **Grid-Tsugi** , we wanted to go beyond in-game footage and capture the essence of the game with real-world locations and meaningful props for storytelling. In this BTS blog, we’ll take you behind the camera to show how we used a variety of props and locations

# ****Pre-Production: Planning the Vision

> "The first step in the trailer-making process was to bring together all the elements that would make it come to life visually. We knew we needed certain locations and props that would not only complement the narrative but also enhance the emotional journey of the trailer. The concept was clear: we needed a few intimate, personal spaces like a living room and bedroom

# **Props and Set Design: Personalizing the Trailer**

> Props play a crucial role in setting the tone for any trailer, so we wanted to make sure ours told a story. For certain scenes, we went a nearby painting school to source beautiful artwork that added a personal touch to the living room and bedroom scenes. These paintings not only helped tell the characters' backstory but also brought authenticity to the setting. The paintings were handpicked from local artists and set the stage for aesthetics.

### **Lighting the scene**

1. **Key Light**: The main light source, placed at a 45-degree angle to create contrast and define the subject.
2. **Fill Light**: Softens shadows from the key light, balancing overall lighting without flattening the scene.
3. **Back Light**: Positioned behind the subject to create depth and separation from the background.
4. **Practical Lights**: In-scene light sources (lamps, windows) that add realism and mood.
5. **Soft vs. Hard Light**: Soft light for flattering, gentle shadows; hard light for dramatic contrast.
6. **Color Temperature**: Warm tones for cozy, cool tones for cold or mysterious moods.

### **Shooting the Trailer**

> "Once we had our locations and props in place, it was time to start filming. The living room and bedroom scenes were shot in a cozy apartment, filled with the vibrant paintings we sourced from the nearby school. But the real challenge came with filming the beach scenes. We wanted . It was the perfect place to film scenes that required space, openness, and emotional depth. The calm waves, golden sand, and provided an ideal backdrop for the trailer’s dramatic moments."

## Why the Fk Games? Our Journey Into VR & Mixed Reality Game Development**

[]()

### **Introduction: The Spark That Got Us Hooked**

> "So, why the hell did we decide to make games? It all started with one simple idea: games are the natural way of storytelling. Unlike books or movies, where you’re just an observer, games pull you into the narrative and let you shape it. You’re not just reading or watching—you’re living the story. And with VR and mixed reality (MR) taking storytelling to the next level, we knew we had to dive in."
> 

> From the beginning, we wanted to create immersive worlds where players feel like they’re part of something bigger, not just passive participants. That’s why we started our journey into VR and MR gaming. And after all the hard work and crazy challenges, we’re beyond excited to share our first title with you: Grid Tsugi. It's a logical, bridge-connecting puzzle game that puts your mind to the test in ways you've never experienced before
> 

                  

### **Why We Chose VR & MR: The Next Level of Storytelling**

> Let's be real—traditional gaming has its place, but VR and MR? That’s a whole new ballgame. It’s not just about graphics or cool mechanics; it’s about immersion. It’s about making the player feel like they're in the game. And that’s what hooked us. VR and MR aren’t just about creating fun games—they’re about telling stories in a way that nothing else can."
> 

> "Games let you interact with the narrative. You’re not just watching the plot unfold—you’re making it happen. With VR, you’re not just controlling a character on a screen, you're inside the world, experiencing it firsthand. MR takes it a step further by blending the virtual world with the real one, making it feel like the game is happening right around you."
> 

> "We were drawn to VR and MR because they’re the future of storytelling. And with these platforms, we wanted to create a game that felt alive, that felt real. That’s where we knew we could push boundaries and bring something fresh to the table.

### **Our Vision: Matching Global Standards, One Step at a Time**

> "Okay, let’s be honest—creating something that stands up to global standards is no easy task. The competition is fierce, and expectations are high. But that’s exactly why we aimed for the stars. We didn’t just want to make a game—we wanted to make something that felt world-class."
> 

> "We focused on three big things:
> 
- **Innovation in Design**: We wanted to create something unique that took full advantage of the VR and MR capabilities, something that hadn't been done before.
- **Player Experience**: We didn’t want just another gimmick—we wanted players to feel like they were truly part of the game world, from start to finish.
- **Global Accessibility**: We wanted a game that players everywhere could connect with. A puzzle game that’s simple to understand but hard to master, accessible to all, while still providing that sweet challenge for those who crave it."

 **Our First Title: Grid Tsugi – A Logical Bridge-Connecting Game**

> "Enter Grid Tsugi, our first title. It’s a logical, bridge-connecting game that puts players in control of building pathways and solving puzzles. Think of it as your mind’s workout with a satisfying sense of progression. The best part? It’s designed specifically for MR, meaning you’ll be right there in the action, physically engaging with the environment, and feeling every move you make."
> 

> "You’re not just solving puzzles on a screen. In Grid Tsugi, you’re actually building bridges with your hands, adjusting them in real-time, and creating the world as you go. The puzzles start easy but get progressively more complex, testing your spatial reasoning and problem-solving skills."
> 

> "It’s all about immersion. The game takes full advantage of VR’s ability to make you feel like you're inside the world. Every puzzle you solve, every bridge you build, is a part of the world you’re creating. The game lets you experience the joy of watching a world unfold right in front of your eyes."
