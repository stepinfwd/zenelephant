## Introduction: The Vision

"Creating a game trailer is not just about showcasing stunning gameplay - it's about crafting an experience that immerses the viewer. For **Grid-Tsugi**, we wanted to go beyond in-game footage and capture the essence of the game with real-world locations and meaningful props for storytelling."

## Pre-Production: Planning the Vision

The first step in the trailer-making process was to bring together all the elements that would make it come to life visually. We knew we needed certain locations and props that would not only complement the narrative but also enhance the emotional journey of the trailer. The concept was clear: we needed a few intimate, personal spaces like a living room and bedroom.

## Props and Set Design: Personalizing the Trailer

Props play a crucial role in setting the tone for any trailer, so we wanted to make sure ours told a story. For certain scenes, we went to a nearby painting school to source beautiful artwork that added a personal touch to the living room and bedroom scenes. These paintings not only helped tell the characters' backstory but also brought authenticity to the setting.

### Lighting the Scene

1. **Key Light**: The main light source, placed at a 45-degree angle to create contrast and define the subject.
2. **Fill Light**: Softens shadows from the key light, balancing overall lighting without flattening the scene.
3. **Back Light**: Positioned behind the subject to create depth and separation from the background.
4. **Practical Lights**: In-scene light sources (lamps, windows) that add realism and mood.
5. **Soft vs. Hard Light**: Soft light for flattering, gentle shadows; hard light for dramatic contrast.
6. **Color Temperature**: Warm tones for cozy, cool tones for cold or mysterious moods.

## Shooting the Trailer

Once we had our locations and props in place, it was time to start filming. The living room and bedroom scenes were shot in a cozy apartment, filled with the vibrant paintings we sourced from the nearby school. But the real challenge came with filming the beach scenes. We wanted the perfect place to film scenes that required space, openness, and emotional depth.

## Why Games? Our Journey Into VR & Mixed Reality Game Development

### Introduction: The Spark That Got Us Hooked

So, why the hell did we decide to make games? It all started with one simple idea: games are the natural way of storytelling. Unlike books or movies, where you're just an observer, games pull you into the narrative and let you shape it. You're not just reading or watching - you're living the story."

From the beginning, we wanted to create immersive worlds where players feel like they're part of something bigger, not just passive participants. That's why we started our journey into VR and MR gaming. And after all the hard work and crazy challenges, we're beyond excited to share our first title with you: **Grid Tsugi**.

### Why We Chose VR & MR: The Next Level of Storytelling

Let's be real - traditional gaming has its place, but VR and MR? That's a whole new ballgame. It's not just about graphics or cool mechanics; it's about immersion. It's about making the player feel like they're in the game.

Games let you interact with the narrative. You're not just watching the plot unfold - you're making it happen. With VR, you're not just controlling a character on a screen, you're inside the world, experiencing it firsthand. MR takes it a step further by blending the virtual world with the real one.

### Our Vision: Matching Global Standards

We focused on three big things:

- **Innovation in Design**: We wanted to create something unique that took full advantage of the VR and MR capabilities
- **Player Experience**: We didn't want just another gimmick - we wanted players to feel like they were truly part of the game world
- **Global Accessibility**: We wanted a game that players everywhere could connect with

### Our First Title: Grid Tsugi - A Logical Bridge-Connecting Game

Enter **Grid Tsugi**, our first title. It's a logical, bridge-connecting game that puts players in control of building pathways and solving puzzles. Think of it as your mind's workout with a satisfying sense of progression. The best part? It's designed specifically for MR, meaning you'll be right there in the action, physically engaging with the environment.

You're not just solving puzzles on a screen. In Grid Tsugi, you're actually building bridges with your hands, adjusting them in real-time, and creating the world as you go. The puzzles start easy but get progressively more complex, testing your spatial reasoning and problem-solving skills.

It's all about immersion. The game takes full advantage of VR's ability to make you feel like you're inside the world. Every puzzle you solve, every bridge you build, is a part of the world you're creating.
